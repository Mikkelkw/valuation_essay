This project is an extensive essay exploring how you would go about valuing assets in todays day and age. The paper takes an indepth look at valuation models, factors and specific variables used as a basis for our conclusions. The reason I chose this project is because it demonstrates a deep understanding of financial modeling and evaluation. This unique perspective is what laid the foundation of my interest in finance.
